# GunLaws
How do regulations on guns (called 'Shall-Issue Laws') affect the violent crime rate? This project aims to answer this question using state-level data and a fixed-effects econometric model.
The "guns.dta" file includes the data used in this project. For documentation on the interpretation of the data, see the "Documentation for Guns Data.docx" file. 
This project was originally for an econometrics class at UTD, so the name of the code file that analyzes the data is called "Final Econ Project Analysis.R" and the report which explains the significance of the results and interprets the econometric relevance is in the file called "Econometrics Final Project.pdf"

A variable selection algorithm was used in addition to the original fixed effects model to understand the effects from shall-issue laws on the violent crime rate. A causal relationship cannot be applied to the results, but valuable insights can be gleamed which may help to inform legislators. The results indicated that shall-issue laws do in fact reduce violent crime rates, but that there are other negative, unintended consequences of shall-issue laws, too. This report provides insight into the complex societal issues that legislators face, and why there is no simple, quick-fix.
